This is the instructions to run the project 4:

1) download all files: P4init.m , raceStat.m , Proj4_MainScript.m , and Proj4_simulink
2) run the files in the following order:
  1) P4init.m
  2) Proj4_MainScript.m

The simulation should automatically be set to run for 3600 simulation seconds as written in the MainScript file when the simulation is called.
The Simulation takes just under 10 minutes total, and should complete about 5 laps wihtout violating any parameters.

The simulation is running without errors, but somewhere in the simulation model the speed it being governed to not exceed 5 mph. I'm not sure what is causing this as the 
speed schedule is intending the car to reach 600 m/s on the straightaways and 20 m/s on the curves but for whatever reason it is. Since there is not a specified number of laps
and you instructed me to turn it in as is I did not investigate this issue further. The PID & Pure pursuit driver is working as I understand it, and the battery SOC does not change 
very much. Since the car does not exceed 5 mph, there is no regenerative braking reaching the battery. The regenerative breaking is disconnected from the battery right now because 
I could not get the car to go faster than 5 mph and therefore could not troubleshoot the regeneration problem. Commented out of the model are some of my attempts to fix the 
breaking and regeneration logic but as I said, I turned it in when I was told.

Thank you again for a great semester, and thank you for all the help.
